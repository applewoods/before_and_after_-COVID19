# Before and after COVID-19: A news analysis of Tourism via semantic network analysis

## 1. Abstract
The current study performed a semantic network analysis on the discourse regarding tourism industry using Naver news articles as the data set. In order to compare the discourse before and after COVID-19, the articles that included the keyword “여행(traveling)” in October 2019 and October 2020 were collected. For Data visualization and Semantic network analysis, NetworkX library was used. Results show that four clusters from 2019 and another four clusters from 2020 were different in that clusters generated for 2019 was mainly focused on travel, outside activities, and boycott of Japan whereas clusters created for 2020 were mainly focused on Corona and political issues. Contrary to previous expectations, the semantic network from the news articles were found to be more about social issues that are far from the content of the tourism industry's damage or individual inconveniences. The result seems to be due to the nature of the news media.
